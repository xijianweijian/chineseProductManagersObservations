# Chinese Product Managers Observations

这是一个个人的观察记录，记录我平日的心得体会，所见所得以及我能够与之对谈的优秀产品经理的观点。
This is a personal observation record that records my personal experience,what I see  what I konw and conversation talk with the excellent product manager in china.

我希望能够提高自己的英语水平，所以我将会尽可能使用双语写作，并没有其他目的（比如装逼），让各位见笑了。如果我的这个小项目能够成为外国同行了解国内同行的窗口就再好不过了。
I hope to improve my English, so I will use bilingual writing as much as possible, there is no other purpose (such as pretend to be something), Thank you for tolerance.Also,I hope my project can be a window for foreign people of the same job to understand chinese internet. 

不同国家的用户差异虽然大，但是这个并不会影响产品经理工作的核心——给用户创造价值。但是产品经理的工作中有许多的变量，一个公司获得巨大成功，回过头去分析其成功的原因其实是很困难的，所以接触尽可能多的案例其实是必须的，尤其是不同国家的案例。如果我们能找到其中的一些共性，则意味着对这份工作的认知更上一层楼。
In my opinion,users from differeent countries may have different habits,but the core of prodcut manager's job is to find a way make sure that his production is useful for customers. There is so many variables in our jobs,when a company get huge success,it is difficult to find out the real reason what make it different.So,to touch more cases is very beneficial for our job,especially in different cultural background.If we can find general characteristics between excellent projects from the whole world,we can get a high level for this job.

这是一个私人项目，意味着我不会对项目中任何的结论负责任，但是我会尽可能追去项目的准确性，如果有人直接借鉴其中结论但是获得了极差的结果，请自行负责。
This project is private,it means I wouldn't take responsibility for anyone if they use some but make a falut in their works.But I will try to make sure that my prodcution is accuracy as far possible as .
